            “The only people for me are the mad ones, the ones who are mad to live, mad to talk, mad to be saved, desirous of
            everything at the same time, the ones who never yawn or say a commonplace thing, but burn, burn, burn like fabulous
            yellow roman candles exploding like spiders across the stars.”

                    “I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my fear.
                    I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
                    Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.”

                You forget some things, dont you?
                Yes. You forget what you want to remember and you remember what you want to forget.”
